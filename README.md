# Advent of Code Solutions

## What is Advent of Code?

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) is an annual set of Christmas-themed computer programming challenges that follow the story of the North Pole elves making necessary preparations for smooth festivity operations, revealed day by day akin to how an Advent calendar is opened. It has been running since 2015. Advent of Code's programming puzzles cover a variety of skill sets and skill levels and can be solved using any programming language, requiring the submission of answers rather than source code. Advent of Code was founded by Eric Wastl, who is still the sole maintainer of the project.

## My Approach to Advent of Code Puzzles

I love solving puzzles in general, and I think it's the best way to learn new subjects with less effort, making the learning journey more fun (it's always fun though). For programming, I found that this Advent of Code project is good for learning programming well and fast without building large projects and wasting a lot of time on basics. I'm not saying building projects is not good (that does not make sense); I mean it's for learning specific concepts every day. Solving problems and trying to create new solutions for the same problem will make you a great programmer, besides doing projects, of course.

Now, I have chosen the C language for solving these puzzles. However, you can choose any programming language. I use C a lot, so C is relevant to me.

## How Should You Use This Repo?

I suggest solving the puzzle and comparing it with my solution, and trying to understand my approach and other people's approaches (if any). So, I highly recommend committing your solution to this repo to see different approaches to the solution (if written in C).
